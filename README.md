Zero Flow tackles Zero-Shot Learning by generating the missing data with Normalizing Flows,a type of Generative Neural Networks. The text and visual domains were connected by conditioning the generation of visual encodings with priorly calculated text encodings. The text encodings ranged from TF-IDF to Transformers. The visual features were obtained from the last layers of pre-trained neural networks. The learned condition with supervised pairs of text and video, allows for the generation of new image vectors from new texts replesing novel classes. The results reached state-of-the-art on CUB2011 and ImageNet dataset.
