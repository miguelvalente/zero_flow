# Zero Flow :cyclone:	

Zero Flow tackle Zero-Shot Learning by simulating or generating missing data with Generative Neural Networks made of Normalizing Flows. For that, I tried to establish a connection between semantics extracted from text, using several text encoding methods and visual features obtained from convolutional neural networks. In the end, the approach proved to be possible in the limited domain of the CUB2011 and ImageNet.
